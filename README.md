This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?


* Negatives work in the list.
* The requirement says numbers, so if this was to expand to real numbers, then all of these would break.

## php
* php php/run.php 30 32 234 234 34 24 25 34 2 12 28 12 18 192 102 20 -3 12
* Found two integers 2 and 28 add to 30

## Go Lang
* This is the first thing I've ever written in GO. I hope it looks okay. Google was my friend.
* go run go\run.go 30 2 29 2 34 35 3145 23 34 -4
